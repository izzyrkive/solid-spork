# solid-spork

Welcome to my personal website/portfolio! On this page, users will find an about me section, a portfolio section featuring my most recent works as a developer and freelance graphic designer, and a contact form so we can get in touch.

# Development Stage

This page is currently functional but still in development, and a contact form will be integrated in the near-future to allow users to communicate with me directly from the contact page.
